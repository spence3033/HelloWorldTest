# Overview

I am very excited to working on projects! I am a software engineer currently trying to improve his understanding of machine learning, but currently the projects I'm thinking of doing will be focused on web or mobile apps. I've wanted to use my programming skills to help make apps that can help some music teachers.

This repository is a test run to create a public Github repository and make sure everything is working correctly.

This program is the classic Hello World test run.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
